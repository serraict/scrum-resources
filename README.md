# scrum-resources

This is a collection of resources we like to use when doing Scrum.

We encourage you to fork this repo and adapt its content for use in your own team.

## Scrum Events Presentations

When starting out with a team or new team members, 
we like to use more detailed teaching slides.
After a couple of sprints, we only use the summary slides. 
Summary slides typically only contain a meeting structure and a DoD for the event.
